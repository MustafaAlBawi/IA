## Project setup

`helpers.py` functions are defined in the helper file. The main focus of these functions is that they are used often and can not be defined under a general classe name.

Classes are collections of methods and logic and can be placed in the classes dir.

The core.py file is where helpers and classes are combined to execute the program. The execution can be done by running `python3 Agent` from one lever higher.

## Syntax usages

Variables: snake_case
